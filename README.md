SBT Plugins
===========

## Publishing

Following the Typesafe lead, we publish our plugins to a [bintray](https://bintray.com/allenai/sbt-plugins).

Bintray does not like snapshot versions, so all of our published versions are releases.

To publish new versions, you will need a bintray account and for it to be added to the bintray allenai organization.

TODO(markschaake): create a generic bintray account for ari-role that all devs can use.
